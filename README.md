<b>PCode</b> formerly known as <i>"Postal Code Lookup"</i>

<b>Technologies Used:</b> HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Ajax, API, Bootstrap

As a little kid, I used to write letters to my long distant relatives around the world. 
However, I always knew the exact address but I was missing the postal code. 
So, I decided to create a web application to lookup any postal code corresponding to its 
address internationally, while experimenting with Ajax and Google's Geocoding API.
